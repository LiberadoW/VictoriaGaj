## Overview

This project is my first website I've created using React. It was created for my friend that is a coach for Victoria Gaj women football team. It features Headless CMS system that was created using Strapi. While creating this project, my main challenge was to scrape data from [this league table](http://www.90minut.pl/liga/1/liga12857.html) and show it on my website. I've solved this problem by creating a simple website scraper.
